# Web Dev II | Assessment 1 - Clone Tasks

For this assessment I was required to make responsive websites using HTML and CSS. Each task was created based on the specifications provided. I designed each website using the wireframes provided for each screen size. Although, where not specified, I made my own appropriate design choices.

This repository contains three folders: 

* **Task 1 - Responsive Layout and Typography**
* **Task 2 - Advanced Layout**
* **Class Activities**
